# CAPITAL SCALING PLAN

## Objective
Grow capital while preserving risk consistency and volatility control.

---

## 1. Fixed Risk Model

Risk per trade remains percentage-based.
Do NOT increase leverage arbitrarily.

---

## 2. Scaling Thresholds

- Capital < $5k → Max 2 positions
- $5k–$20k → Max 3 positions
- $20k+ → Portfolio risk cap reduced to 2%

---

## 3. Drawdown-Based Scaling

If drawdown > 15%:
- Reduce risk per trade by 50%
- Resume normal risk only after equity high restored

---

## 4. Compounding Rule

Increase position sizing only via equity growth.
No manual risk override.

---

## 5. Profit Extraction Rule

Optional professional discipline:

- Withdraw 20% of profits quarterly
- Maintain base capital floor

---

## 6. Crisis Protocol

If monthly loss > 12%:
- Pause system
- Conduct performance audit
- Revalidate parameter stability
