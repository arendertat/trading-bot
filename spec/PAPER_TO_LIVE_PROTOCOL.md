# PAPER → LIVE TRANSITION PROTOCOL

## Phase 1: Paper Mode (Minimum 30 days)

Requirements:
- Stable execution
- No crashes
- Daily reports functioning
- Risk engine triggers properly
- Expectancy positive

---

## Phase 2: Micro Live (10–20% capital)

- Deploy with reduced risk (0.5% per trade)
- Monitor slippage difference vs paper
- Validate correlation filter behavior

Minimum duration: 30 days

---

## Phase 3: Controlled Scaling

Increase risk only if:

- Live performance aligns with paper
- No infrastructure failures
- No unexpected behavior under volatility

---

## Rollback Conditions

Immediately revert to paper mode if:

- Unexpected slippage spike
- Stop-loss fails to trigger
- API instability
- Weekly drawdown > 10%

---

## Capital Protection Rule

Never deploy full capital immediately.
Incremental scaling only.
